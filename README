# Chainloader #

This is the SteamOS stage 1 bootloader (chainloader).

It is a standalone UEFI application built on top of gnu-efi: Although it
should be possible to port to Tiano instead (and some effort has been made
to keep the gnu-efi call isolated to one or two files to make this easier)
this has not been attempted yet.

The broad goals and reason for the design are given in the SteamOS
documentation repo (eg in SteamOS/bootloader-and-partition-layout.md):
This file will focus more on the actual implementation details.

## Boot Sequence ##

## Stage 1: Chainloader ####

 * The chainloader starts
 * It checks the directory it was loaded from for the following flag files:
   * PREALLOC_DEBUGLOG "steamcl-debug.log"
     * If present treated as a fixed size file into which to write all
       debug, warning, and log messages (numbered and with timestamps).
     * If logging reaches the end of the file, messages start being
       written at the start of the file again.
     * 3 KiB of log should be sufficient to avoud wrap around
   * FLAGFILE_RESTRICT "steamcl-restricted"
     * If present, do not consider any other media to boot from,
       ie don't check USB sticks or other hard discs for SteamOS images
   * FLAGFILE_VERBOSE  "steamcl-verbose"
     * Emit some debug messages to stdout.
   * FLAGFILE_NVDEBUG  "steamcl-nvram-debug"
     * Log some extra debug info in UEFI variables
     * The chainloader does not write to disc
     * The chainloader does set some volatile UEFI variables even if
       this is not present, but it should never write to NVRAM without it
  * All UEFI bootable filesystems (basically VFAT) are checked
    * If FLAGFILE_RESTRICT is in effect those on other media (discs) are ignored
    * If FLAGFILE_RESTRICT is NOT in effect, bootconf files in the old location
      (/SteamOS/bootconf on an EFI partition) are migrated to the new location,
      (SteamOS/conf/X.conf) on the ESP partition.
      * X is the image label (A, B, dev)
      * X is found by comparing partuuids from /SteamOS/partsets/*
      * NOTE: this only happens if there is no file already at the new location
      * See README.bootconf for specification
    * The bootconf files are sorted by boot-requested-at value, oldest to newest
      * Any bootconfs that have image-invalid set are considered older than
        any that don't
    * Each sorted bootconf is then checked, starting with the newest.
      * If boot-other is set, we skip this config and proceed to the next
      * If not, we choose this image
  * The chainloader checks for the "oneshot" UEFI variable
    * If any of the following are true:
      * oneshot is set
      * No config was picked
      * <f3> is being held down
        * A boot menu is displayed to let the user choose a boot option
  * If no boot option has been picked yet the newest SteamOS entry is selected
  * If the chosen entry was flagged for update
    * steamos-update=1 is added to the bootloader command line
    * ENTRY_FLAG_UPDATE is ORed into chainloader entry flags UEFI variable
  * These two mechanisms are redundant, either will trigger an update
    * The chosen bootloader is executed. By default:
      /EFI/SteamOS/grubx64.efi on the chosen EFI fs

### Stage 2: The bootloader ###

This is a mostly vanilla boot sequence with the following additions:

 * If the chainloader boot attempts NVRAM UEFI variable is set, it is zeroed
 * The loader flags variable is read into memory if set (see above)
 * The bootconf file is parsed
   * boot-attempts is incremented by 1 (in memory)
   * If any of the following are true:
     * steamos-update=1 is present on the command line
     * the flags contain ENTRY_FLAG_UPDATE
   * If boot-attempts exceeds a built in value, the image-invalid flag is set
     * This does not disable booting, it lowers this image's priority
   * The bootconf file is saved - this can set the following items on disc:
     * image-invalid may go from 0 to 1
     * boot-attempts can increase by 1
   * If the update flag is set the following is added to the kernel command line
     * systemd.unit=steamos-update-os.target
   * The kernel + initrd are loaded and executed

### Stage 3: The OS ###

Not much to say here, except it is up to the OS to run some
diagnostics and set the bootconf boot-attempts value to 0 if the boot
process has been deemed a success.
